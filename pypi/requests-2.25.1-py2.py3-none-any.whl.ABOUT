description: Requests allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. You can add headers, form data, multipart
  files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the response data in the
  same way. It's powered by httplib and urllib3, but it does all the hard work and crazy hacks
  for you.
