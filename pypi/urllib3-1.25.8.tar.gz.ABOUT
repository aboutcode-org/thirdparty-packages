  urllib3 is a powerful, sanity-friendly HTTP client for Python. Much of the Python ecosystem already uses urllib3 and you should too. urllib3 brings many critical features that are missing from the Python standard libraries:
      Thread safety.
      Connection pooling.
      Client-side SSL/TLS verification.
      File uploads with multipart encoding.
      Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.
      Support for gzip and deflate encoding.
      Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.
      100% test coverage.
