description: Requests allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. You can add headers, form data, multipart
  files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the response data in the
  same way. Itâ€™s powered by httplib and urllib3, but it does all the hard work and crazy hacks
  for you.
